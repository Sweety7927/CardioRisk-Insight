# Heart-Disease-Prediction
# Objective
A detailed exploratory data analysis on a heart disease dataset (918 records, 12 clinical features) to uncover key patterns, correlations, and risk indicators affecting cardiovascular health. The goal was to understand how factors such as age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and exercise-induced angina contribute to heart-disease risk and to prepare the dataset for predictive modeling.
# Key Insights
Data Quality: No missing values detected; dataset is analysis-ready.

Age Factor: Patients aged 50–69 show the highest heart-disease prevalence (~74%).

Cholesterol: Higher and more variable in heart-disease patients; significant outliers detected.

ST Slope & Angina: Flat ST slope and exercise-induced angina (“Y”) strongly linked to disease.

Chest Pain Type: Asymptomatic (ASY) most common (54%) among affected individuals.

Correlations: Moderate relationships between clinical variables; potential for feature selection.

Outliers-Found mainly in Cholesterol (≈20%) and FastingBS (≈23%).
# Outputs
Cleaned dataset: cleaned_dataset.csv

EDA report: Visual and statistical insights (plots, heatmaps, correlation maps)

Ready for modeling: Data suitable for predictive ML tasks and clinical decision support

# Summary
This EDA highlights how age, cholesterol, chest-pain type, and exercise-induced angina are crucial indicators of heart disease. The cleaned, insight-rich dataset now serves as a foundation for predictive analytics and early risk assessment models.
